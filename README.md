DESCIPTION:   
Introduction
File handling is an essential aspect of programming that allows developers to store, retrieve, and modify data efficiently. This project focuses on creating a C++ application that demonstrates reading, writing, and appending operations on text files. It will serve as a practical example of how file handling works in C++, using the fstream library. The project aims to showcase various techniques used for managing files, ensuring proper data handling and storage.

Project Objective:  

The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly C++ application that enables users to:  
1)Create and write data to a file.  
2)Read existing data from a file.  
3)Append new data to an already existing file.  
4)Display file content after modifications.
This application will be interactive, allowing users to choose different operations via a menu-driven interface.

Technologies and Concepts Used:  
1)C++ Programming Language – The core language for implementing file operations.  
2)fstream Library – Used for handling file input/output operations.  
3)Text Files (.txt) – The type of file format used for data storage.  
4)File Handling Techniques – Writing, reading, and appending data efficiently.  
User Interaction – A simple menu-based system for ease of use.

Project Implementation:
The program will follow a structured approach with three primary functions:

1. Writing to a File
The program will prompt the user to enter text data.
The entered data will be written to a file (e.g., data.txt).
If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically.
Existing content will be overwritten when writing new data.

2. Reading from a File
The program will open the specified file in read mode.
It will read the content line by line and display it on the screen.
If the file does not exist, an error message will be displayed.

3. Appending Data to a File
The program will allow users to add new data to an existing file without deleting previous content.
The appended data will be written at the end of the file.
